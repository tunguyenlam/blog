            "content": "$A^*$ is an algorithm to find the best path between 2 points. A is a popular algorithm and applied in many practice application especially in routing or map. It is based on best-first-search mechanisim, similarly with Dijkstra, and heuritic mechanism. $A^$ aims to optimize both of the path from start point to current point and the path from current point to end point. Than, it has formal formula: $$f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$$ .",

            "content": "Generate sample data . To generate sample data, we need to build a model for time series. . The simplest way to depict the time series is by using linear model: . $$y = x^T * theta$$ . Basically, it estimates a line between data points. And it try to optimize the residuals between estimated results and actual results. However, this way does not describe some essensials of time series problem, such as treding or period. So, we will use a more complex model to depict the time series. . $$y = intercept + trend(t) + period(t) + nuisance$$ . import numpy as np m = 1000 intercept = 50 trend = 0.5 period = lambda t: np.sin(2*np.pi*t/180) nuisance = np.random.normal(0,120, m) t = np.arange(m) y = intercept + trend * t + 120*period(t) + nuisance[t] . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot(y) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7fc33f3f9c88&gt;] . The time series above has both trend and seasonality. We can easily generate the stationary time series by get the nuisance only. . t = np.arange(m) y = intercept + nuisance[t] plt.plot(y) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7fc33f3aa710&gt;] . Similarity, we can generate the time series with period only. . y = intercept + period(t) plt.plot(y) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7fc33f258f28&gt;] .",

            "content": "Time Series is a type of data or a problem in machine learning. In Time Series, data points are generated by the time and follow some patterns such as trending or period. Time series is very popular problem in reality, especially in trading. The price of stock or number of product sales are time series examples. . . Basically, Time series is a collection of data points. Each data point has 2 attributes: value and time. The data points are sorted by their time in order to put into collection. time is something we know it but value is uncertainty and we did not know it beforehand. Then, a data point depends on its period (time) and its trending (how big of its value). . When the time factor does not effect to value of data points, we call this time series is stationary. Otherwise, time series is trending or seasonal. In above images, there are stationary time series in b)g): . Obvious seasonality rules out series (d), (h) and (i). Trends and changing levels rules out series (a), (c), (e), (f) and (i). Increasing variance also rules out (i). That leaves only (b) and (g) as stationary series. At first glance, the strong cycles in series (g) might appear to make it non-stationary. But these cycles are aperiodic— they are caused when the lynx population becomes too large for the available feed, so that they stop breeding and the population falls to low numbers, then the regeneration of their food sources allows the population to grow again, and so on. In the long-term, the timing of these cycles is not predictable. Hence the series is stationary. .",
