    "   Time Series is a type of data or a problem in machine learning. In Time Series, data points are generated by the time and follow some patterns such as trending or period. Time series is very popular problem in reality, especially in trading. The price of stock or number of product sales are time series examples. "

The data points are sorted by their time in order to put into collection. time is something we know it but value is uncertainty and we did not know it beforehand.

In the long-term, the timing of these cycles is not predictable. Hence the series is stationary.\n",
